        <!-- if git status pulls up modified files, git is telling us, use git add if you wnat this file's changes to be included in the next commit. -->

            <!-- Git Workflow â€“ HTML Notes
              (Create initial stuff/html etc)
              -	init
              -	add and commit
              -	(make changes)
              -	Add and commit
              -	(make more changes)
              -	Add and commit
              - general rule: whenever you make changes, you must add/commit those changes to Git.
              guiding principle is that you should pause and commit any time you have reached a natural stopping point and completed a coherent "chunk of work"
Add command gives opportunity to specify which files should be included in upcoming commit. opportunity allows us to do 2 separate commits. you can also add both files in same commit, git add index.html or git add styles.css and git add .
IMPORTANT: always check 'git status' before running git add. to be sure you wnat to add ALL changes which add . does. if not, then only add the changed files specifically you would like to rather than all.
